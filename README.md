# email-sender-powershell
<b>Email sender made in powershell using gmail with App Password.</b>

I have experienced to work with a <b>Windows Server 2008</b>.<br/>
What I was doing to this Customer was taking data from a SQL Server and then sending an email whenever his machine has registered a certain temperature for a specific time.

<b>Why did I choose powershell and not the better known python?</b><br/>
It's simple, that server didn't have this <b>windows library</b>: <b>'api-ms-win-core-path-|1-1-0.dll'</b> and I was really mad about it because the previous version, in python, seems to use this library. 
So I have created this powershell that works perfectly with that old system.

Feel free to ask anything about it!
